# Color Picker
There was a great little utility I used to use that I can't seem to find anymore, so I decided to make my own. Color picker is a very simple color picker application for windows, written in C# .NET 4.6.2. 

# What does it do?
You can very easily click and drag the cursor to the color you want information on, and the color picker will show you the Plain text name, hex value, rgb value, and hsl value that you can then copy into your project.
